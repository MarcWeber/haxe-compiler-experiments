<h1>The haXe Programming Language</h1>

<script type="text/javascript" src="menu.js"></script>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	The Web is evolving quickly, with different technologies needed at different places. For instance, if you want to create a website now you'll have to handle several languages :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>on the <b>server</b> side : a <em>web</em> language such as PHP, Perl, Ruby or Python.</li>
	<li>on the <b>client</b> side : HTML and CSS.</li>
	<li>for <b>rich clients</b> : Flash (ActionScript 1, 2 and now 3) and Javascript / DHTML / AJAX.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The haXe programming language is uniting theses different <em>platforms</em> under one language. It brings features that are making it easy to deal with a dynamic world such as DHTML or Databases, while still bringing you a full-featured type system with a compiler that will detect errors early in the development phase.
</p>

<p>
	Basicly, what haXe can do is :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>create <b>Flash SWF</b> files using Flash APIs for Players 6,7,8 and soon 8.5.</li>
	<li>generate <b>Javascript code</b> using Browser DHTML API, so you can create AJAX web applications.</li>
	<li>generate <b>Neko sourcecode</b> that can be used on the Server side or in standalone executable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Each of theses <em>platforms</em> have their own API, but they share the same programming language and the same standard library, so if your classes are <em>pure code</em> (using no platform-specific API) then they can be compiled and used everywhere, depending on your needs.
</p>

<p>
	Also, haXe make it easy to <b>interoperate</b> between theses different <em>platforms</em>, by providing common <em>protocol</em> libraries. Please note that it's still possible to use haXe on only one platform if you want for example keep your current working code.
</p>

<p>
	We will now detail how haXe can be useful for each supported <em>platform</em>.
</p>

<h2>Flash SWF</h2>

<p>
	If you want to create really rich internet applications, such as Games, highly-interactive user interfaces, applications using sound or video streaming, then Flash is the platform of choice for you. However, there is several showstoppers if you want to use Flash.
</p>

<p>
	On of them is that there is currenty <b>three</b> different programming languages for Flash (here's a little overview) :
</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>ActionScript 1</em> : quite complete since Flash player 5, more mature in player 6. This is a Javascript variant (untyped , with no classes). Still widely used in order to make small quick scripts in Flash.</li>
	<li><em>ActionScript 2</em> : since Flash MX 2004. Can be compiled to players 6 and more. Add a type-system with classes to JavaScript. Have several problems since Macromedia compiler is really slow, and the language itself is a little too permitive for easily developing serious applications.</li>
	<li><em>ActionScript 3</em> : in alpha right now, supported by Flash Player 8.5 with a new virtual machine with JIT. Try to be Java, without the good features such as Generics.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Although you would like to use latest AS3 language, you still can't right now since the Player is still in alpha release, that means it's still one or two years early before the player get widely distributed on end-user computers. You have then the choice to keep using previous versions of ActionScript, but their futures are compromised by the existence of AS3.
</p>

<p>
	<b>haXe</b> is solution to this problem. It brings one language, that is current compiling to Flash Player 6 and more, and will support in the future the new virtual machine in Flash Player 8.5 as well as new API when they will be available. It means that :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>you can start using <b>haXe</b> right now for making SWF</li>
	<li>porting your code for AS1/AS2 to haXe is not more difficult than porting it to AS3</li>
</ul>


<p>
	The <b>haXe</b> compiler is <em>compiling</em> several haXe classes and files into a single <b>SWF</b> file that can be deployed on your webserver as usual.
</p>

<h2>Javascript</h2>

<p>
	Today another way of building Rich Internet Applications or simply adding some interactivity to a website is to use the Javascript language (also called DHTML or AJAX technologies). Javascript is a dynamicly typed programming language with no classes and is running on the client side with some differences between Browsers API.
</p>

<p>
	Writing small Javascript applications takes time. Mainly because unless you are familiar with DHTML API and Browser differences, you need a lot of tests to make it work correctly. On another point, scaling medium and large Javascript applications is also difficult because of the lack of ways to structure your application (using classes for instance).
</p>

<p>
	<b>haXe</b> is helpful here, because it brings you the whole DHTML API and give you a type system to check that you're using them correctly. Some features of the type system are especialy designed to play nice with the inheritent dynamic typing of DHTML. You can also use classes to structure your program, and easily interact with <b>haXe</b> code running in Flash and on the server side.
</p>

<p>
	The <b>haXe</b> compiler is <em>generating</em> some valid Javascript source code from several haXe classes and files, so you only have to generate one time and then include the .js as usual in your webpage.
</p>

<h2>Neko and NekoVM</h2>

<p>
	A lot of different web languages are available right now, with some such as PHP that are very popular and widely used. Still, most of theses languages are either interpreted or running on slow virtual machines, resulting in low performances and need for powerful servers.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="http://nekovm.org">Neko Virtual Machine</a> is a very fast - still lightweight - VM that can easily be embeded into any application. It can run Neko bytecode and easily be extended using C DLLs. In particular, there is a <code>mod_neko</code> for the Apache webserver that can be used to write websites using the Neko programming language.
</p>

<p>
	The Neko programming language is a medium-level dynamicly typed programming language that can be used as a target for different compilers. For example, the <b>haXe</b> compiler has a Neko <em>generator</em> so you can actually run any haXe program on the NekoVM, but it also means that you can also interact with other high-level programming languages that have a Neko generator.
</p>

<p>
	The <b>haXe</b> programming language can then be executed using the <b>NekoVM</b>, which is available on the <em>server side</em> using Apache, from the <em>commandline</em>, or can be <em>embedded</em> into your standalone binary application. This greatly increase the number of usages you can have with one single programming language.
