Subject: [PATCH] t/short-lambda2

Take this patch with care - I don't know yet what I'm doing.

This patch adds short lambdas to HaXe similar to what can be done in Scala:

var f1 = _1; // same as var a = function(a){ return a; }
var f2 = _1 + _2; // same as var a = function(a,b){ return a + b; }

etc.

Scala only allows unnamed parameters without index. Thus _ + _ is always treated as _1 + _2.
However you can'd describe _2 / _1 functions then. That's why I chose to index
the unnamed parameters.


How does a function differ from a simple expression which gets evaluated immediately?
Only by containing _nr values.

// cases like this wil break by this change:

  var _1 = "foo";
  var f = _1;

But they are very likely to be caught by the type system of HaXe.
